It’s a new year! and we’ve got lots planned for 2016 for all of our themes including major design and feature improvements to be made to Listify. Nope your eyes aren’t deceiving you, we really are looking prettier today – thanks for noticing. We’ve made many changes to the interface of the Listify theme to start off 2016, with a lot more feature to come!

To say we are excited would be an understatement. In the 1.3.0 release of Listify we’ve added a new Style Kits option that gives power to change the look of your Listify site at just a click of a button, and we’ve added full control over every element of the design in terms of color, button styling, content styling, typography and much more.

Lets dig into what we’ve added:

New: “Style Kits” visit “Appearance > Customize > Style Kits” and make your Listify website unique to you!
New: “Font Packs” visit “Appearance > Customize > Typography” and adjust the typography of your website.
New: “Color Schemes” visit “Appearance > Customize > Colors” to see the newly available color schemes.
New: “Content” options visit “Appearance > Customize > Content” to adjust content layout and display options.
New: “Listings” options visit “Appearance > Customize > Listings” to adjust new listing options.
New: “Tags” widget design updates. Visit “Appearance > Customize > Listings > Listing Tags” to set icons for assigned tags.
New: Show gallery image descriptions if available.
New: Browse Astoundify WP Job Manager add-ons in “Listings > Add-ons”.
New: Dynamically register FacetWP template.
New: More helpful placeholders for inputs.
New: Setup Guide improvements.
Fix: Date internationalization for Business Hours widget.
Fix: FacetWP internationalization options.
Fix: Revert to standard the_content() call so shortcodes are parsed.
Fix: Social Login on checkout causing toggle issues on login form.
